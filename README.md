About:

cfc is a Firefox addon that attempts to improve the Tor Browser user
experience.  Primarily by interpreting CloudFlare as damage and routing
around it.

It is intended as a proof of concept with some features incurring a
fairly substantial reduction in privacy/anonymity and MUST NOT BE USED BY
AT RISK USER BASES.

Notes:

 * The circumvention method used defeats Tor Browser's built in session
   isolation.  Fixing this issue correctly requires a Tor Browser patch.
   You have been warned, twice.

 * The name was chosen because it punches holes in censorship/blocking like
   chlorofluorocarbons punch holes in the ozone layer, and any resemblance
   to "CloudFlare Fucking Captcha" is entirely coincidental.
